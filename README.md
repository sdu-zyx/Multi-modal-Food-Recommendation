## Dataset 
Please download the processed datasets from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xCKlKpTnHpiNwjTNLT1yIDB-Srwsv0yz?usp=sharing).

### Dataset Preprocessing
If you have downloaded the processed datasets, you can directly use them for reproduction and further experiments.
If you want to know the details of data preprocessing, please see the instructions below.
#### Download and process raw datasets
Please download the raw datasets from the original website.

For the Allrecipes dataset, please download from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elisaxxygao/foodrecsysv1/data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elisaxxygao/foodrecsysv1/data). And then execute [allrecipes_process.ipynb](..%2Fdataset_process%2Fallrecipes_process.ipynb) to process data.

For the Foodcom dataset, please download from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions/data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions/data). And execute [foodcom_process.ipynb](..%2Fdataset_process%2Ffoodcom_process.ipynb) to process data.

For the image of Foodcom dataset, please download using [download_image.py](..%2Fdataset_process%2Fdownload_image.py), and [download_check.py](..%2Fdataset_process%2Fdownload_check.py).

Only for CLUSSL model, Construct Bipartite Graph via Continuous Features, execute [allrecipes_kmeans.ipynb](..%2Fdataset_process%2Fallrecipes_kmeans.ipynb) and [foodcom_kmeans.ipynb](..%2Fdataset_process%2Ffoodcom_kmeans.ipynb) to obtain modality-specific graph edges.

### Dataset path
Change the data_path according to your absolute path in configs/overall.yaml

And change the below code in utils/quick_start.py 

```
    config['interaction_data_path'] = config['data_path'] + dataset + '/processed_dataset/'
    config['graph_data_path'] = config['data_path'] + dataset + '/processed_dataset/graph_edge/'
    config['ingre_data_path'] = config['data_path'] + dataset + '/processed_dataset/'
```

## Run the code

Make sure all dependencies package are installed

```
python runner.py
```

## Build your model

Build your model like models/cikm_model.py or models/schgn.py
And use yaml files to configure your model parametersï¼Œlike configs/cikm_model.yaml or configs/SCHGN.yaml


## Acknowledgement
The implementation is based on the open-source recommendation library [MMRec](https://github.com/enoche/MMRec).
